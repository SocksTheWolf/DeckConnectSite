  header: "FAQ"
  items:
    - question: Do I need to purchase?
      answer: In 99% of the cases, the answer is yes (unless the application has a bulk distribution agreement with Editor support). 
    - question: Do end users of the packaged game/application need to purchase DeckConnect?
      answer: Nope, only if they are creating their own DeckConnect Actions.
    - question: How can I be sure if I need to buy?
      answer: Feel free to [send us a message](/contact), we can figure it out.
    - question: Are there any other places I can purchase this from?
      answer: Currently, the only purchase option is from the FAB marketplace. We might expand to other markets in the future.
    - question: Does the plugin come with any default DeckConnect Actions that can be used?
      answer: Currently no, as DeckConnect is meant to be uniquely integrated into an Unreal Application.
    - question: How can I share my DeckConnect Actions with others?
      answer: Share the DeckConnect `Actions` config data in `DefaultGame.ini` with anyone you want to use your Actions. Then just share your code/bp directly.
    - question: I have more questions, where should I go?
      answer: Contact us about any further questions [here](/contact).
