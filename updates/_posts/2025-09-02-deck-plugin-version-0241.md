Version v0.2.4.1 is now on the Elgato marketplace. This updates some dependencies and runtimes, and adds support for the latest Stream Deck devices.

Additionally, it adds a bit more logging on start up to help detect and fix any errors.

If you are logged into an Elgato account on your Stream Deck, you should get the update automatically.
Otherwise, you can [download it here](/deck).
