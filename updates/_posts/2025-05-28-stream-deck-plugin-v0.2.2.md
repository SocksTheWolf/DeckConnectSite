Version v0.2.2 has been pushed to the Elgato Maker Marketplace. This update adds the ability to change DeckConnect's connection port. Such a feature is currently already available in the Unreal Plugin, but the Stream Deck plugin did not have a matching setting.

Stream Deck clients will automatically update to the new version upon approval.

To learn how to change the port value, please see [this tips post](/tips/2025/05/28/changing-connection-settings).
