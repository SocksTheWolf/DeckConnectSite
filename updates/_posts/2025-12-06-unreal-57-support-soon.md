I'm currently at work updating DeckConnect to work with the newest Unreal Engine version (5.7.1). This will take awhile as it will have to also pass the standard Fab manual review, but I hope to get it out in a few days!
Thank you so much for using DeckConnect I really hope it has been helpful for all of you!
