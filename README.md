# DeckConnect Website

This is the code behind the Jekyll website for [DeckConnect](https://deckconnect.me). I made this in a fever dream that lasted about two days. I loathe writing CSS, so get ready for that nightmare.

The resulting site theme is a combination of:

* Edits that I made on a personal fork of the abandoned Jekyll theme, [Hydra by CloudCannon](https://github.com/CloudCannon/hydra-jekyll-template)
* Edits of the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme.

Some layouts (specifically the downloads one) are inspired, lifted or derived from the Hydra theme.

This site is hosted on Github pages because it's quick and easy.
