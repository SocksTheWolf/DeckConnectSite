source:
  - name: Unreal
    issues:
      - problem: Copy/Pasting Data values other than Name in the DeckConnect settings window does nothing. This is intentional to prevent disastrous data loss.
        solution: If you want to share actions, copy and paste the actions from the config file instead.
      - problem: Versions earlier than `1.00.07` will append a "0" at the end of any DeckConnect Action name incorrectly.
        solution: This is fixed in latest versions.
  - name: Elgato
    issues:
      - problem: On first install of the Elgato plugin, the _very first_ action button in the Stream Deck software will not work.
        solution: This is fixed by simply recreating the action button in the Stream Deck application. Only the first button exhibits this behavior.
