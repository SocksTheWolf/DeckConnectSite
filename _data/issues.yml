          Copy/Pasting Data values other than Name in the DeckConnect settings window does nothing.  
          This is intentional to prevent disastrous data loss.
        solution: If you want to share actions, copy and paste the actions from the config file instead.
      - problem: A `0` character is appended to the end of a DeckConnect Action name.
        solution: Update to the latest version
        fixed_in: 1.00.07

    id: streamdeck
    issues:
      - problem: On first install of the Elgato plugin, the _very first_ action button in the Stream Deck software may not work.
        solution: Update to the latest version or recreate the action in the Stream Deck application.
        fixed_in: 0.2.4.2
